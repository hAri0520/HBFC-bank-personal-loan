# HBFC-bank-personal-loan

### Context:
This case is about a bank (HBFC Bank) which has a growing customer base. Majority of these customers are customers having deposits (Saving, Current) and Term Deposit (including Fixed Deposits and Recurring deposit accounts) in the bank. The number of customers who are also borrowers (customers having loan accounts) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways of converting its customers having deposits to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors).

The bank wants to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. For doing that, the first step in this regard is to explore the previous data and drill insights.

### Business Objective:
The outcome is to explore the data to understand the variables and the impact they have had on Personal Loans so that the bank can leverage the insights to reach out to the right customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan.

### Approach:
The collected data is cleaned through various data wrangling techniques available in MS Excel and the resulted clean data is used to perform further Exploratory Data Analysis and brought out some of the valuable insights which the bank can implicate in their business to reach out to the right customer base in order to increase their probability of purchasing the loan.
